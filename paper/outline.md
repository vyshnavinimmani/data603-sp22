# BIG DATA IN FINANCIAL FRAUD DETECTION
## Summary : 

Combating financial risks in the big data era requires going beyond traditional data, algorithms, and systems. New methods for risk detection, assessment, and forecasting are being proposed. Initially data is identified to study how big data can be combined with the emerging tools to effectively learn or analyze financial risk.

## Introduction to Fraud detection in Financial Industry:

Financial service companies are more prone to cyber-attacks compared to other industries. Banking industry is more data intensive and digital banking has brought up many new challenges concerning cyber security and fraud risks. Cashless transactions, web services reduced contacts with clients and paved a new path in collecting valuable customer data using digital channels. Financial fraud includes account fraud, credit card fraud, forging checks and insurance fraud. 
Fraud detection is set of activities done  by institutions to prevent unauthorized financial activity. Fraud can destabilize economies and effect peoples cost of living. Traditional approaches like auditing, were inefficient and unreliable due to growing trends. 

## Role of Big Data in financial fraud detection:

Big data technology transformed data storage with Operational Data Lakes(ODL) which stores both structured and unstructured raw data. Big data processing platforms like Apache Hadoop, Apache storm, Google BigQuery provide open-source frameworks allowing parallel processing by distributing huge datasets across many servers. Data mining for fraud prevention relies on pattern analysis to find suspicious outliers and trends and the source of data is big data. The combination of big data , AI and Machine learning are used in preventing frauds.

## Specific models used to combat fraud:
 
 Recommendations from AI, NLP models, Deep Neural Networks, ML Algorithms linear regression, Naive Bayes methods, and classic Hidden Markov models (HMM) were traditional models used before introduction of big data. 

## Implementation of models in the data lakes you would find at financial institutions: 

The key is to invest in fraud solutions that feature data lake capabilities. Data lakes draw in data from structured and unstructured sources, at scale and speed. These sources can be business applications like CRM and ERP repositories, social media, device data, server logs, international blacklists, internal whitelists, messaging, and comms platforms.
Data lake is the foundational layer on which we build  models to spot sophisticated fraud patterns. Companies are using prevailing technology and big data analytics tools to combat against financial frauds. Big data analytics is used to identify patterns and behaviors, and to collect information that allows fraud to be identified accurately and efficiently and use that intelligence to operate appropriately. 
1.  Big data analytics, with its coexistent model of parallel computing with help  of  cloud, organizations have their own intensive computing data centers. Parallel computing enables organizations to study, map and normalize large amounts of data to analyze effectively.

2. Continuous or behavioral authentication  based on classic Markov models is done by  studying the pattern of customer usage by encoder-decoder method. Recurrent neural networks (RNNs), recurrent structures like long short-term memory (LSTM) are used to model sequences.

3.PALE identifies structural links in unsupervised data and finds matching pairs.

4. Map Reduce is a technology used to work with large data sets across clusters of computers, assigning tasks to worker nodes and then collecting the results from the multiple processors by reducing them into one.

5. NLP models such as BERT and GPT-3 has shown impressive results in generating high-quality texts by initially trained on large-scale corpora collected from the web.

## Conclusion:

Data insights can be used for continuous prevention of frauds â€“ as long as tools are quick to collect and analyze information.

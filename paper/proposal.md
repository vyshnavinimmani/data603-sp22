> # BIG DATA IN FINANCIAL FRAUD DETECTION

## Financial Industry:
Financial service companies are more prone to cyber-attacks compared to other industries. Banking industry is more data intensive and digital banking has brought up many new challenges concerning cyber security and fraud risks. Cashless transactions, web services reduced contacts with clients and paved a new path in collecting valuable customer data using digital channels. Financial fraud includes account fraud, credit card fraud, forging checks and insurance fraud. Financial fraud detection is necessary to reduce risk for institutions.

## Fraud detection:
Fraud detection is set of activities done  by institutions to prevent unauthorized financial activity. Fraud can destabilize economies and effect peoples cost of living. Traditional approaches like auditing, were inefficient and unreliable due to growing trends. 

## Technological solutions for Fraud detection:
In this paper we will focus on big data, artificial intelligence (AI)  and Machine learning models that can be adopted in detecting Fraud. Big data technology transformed data storage with Operational Data Lakes(ODL) which stores both structured and unstructured raw data. Big data processing platforms like Apache Hadoop, Apache storm, Google BigQuery provide open-source frameworks allowing parallel processing by distributing huge datasets across many servers. Data mining for fraud prevention relies on pattern analysis to find suspicious outliers, trends and the source of data is big data. The combination of big data , AI and Machine learning are used in preventing frauds.

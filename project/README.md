# Philly city crime dataset analysis 
The Notebook contains Philly city crime data analysis for the last ten years (2011-2021).The dataset was collected from Philadelphia official website which has many public datasets.<br>This readme file provides an overview of the project and how I conducted my analysis.
## Dataset Description
For this project I have used two datasets ,the first dataset is crime dataset which contains information about the crime that is time, location, category and place. The second dataset is about weather. The dataset consists of 14 columns and 2.9 million rows (dataset size 1.38GB). The dataset has information about the crimes reported from 2001 in the city of Philly city. 
* The dataset about the crime and weather can be found in the Philly city's official [website.]( https://metadata.phila.gov/index.html#home/). 
The aim of the project is to find crimes that occurred in different weather conditions, the crime rate trend across the years, and during which month and hour of the day the crime rate was highest. Dataset had many null values, so I had to perform EDA before transforming the data. For plotting, so I will use matplotlib to plot and  use SQL to join the datasets.
## About this Repository
The repository contains an ipynb file with project code, the presentation slides in pdf format, and two datasets containing information about Philly city's crime reports. 
The primary crime dataset was extremely huge, so I have attached a document file containing a link to the dataset. The readme file contains all project-related instructions and information. 
### How to run the notebook:
To run the notebook, we use SQL functions, matplotlib, and other basic libraries installed, as mentioned in the notebook. The notebook needs to be run step by step from the beginning, and colab notebook should have attached datasets uploaded. The first dataset is a large file so takes lot of space and time to read the file. The link for both datasets are in [website.]( https://metadata.phila.gov/index.html#home/).

# NoSQL  database management systems Vs Models
## Introduction 
Traditional relational database models involve tables with rows and columns. Non-relational database models evolved over a period, and these are called NoSQL database.
### Limits of Relational databases:
A database management system(DBMS)  gives  us access to manage data, run queries and tasks related to database. Database is collection of data and DBMS is specific software that allows us to interact with database.
DBMS  employ structured query language(SQL) for managing and accessing data within database. Relational model is mostly used approach and limitations of this model are 
1. Horizontal scaling or scaling out.
2. works with  only structured data.
## NoSQL database:
In 1998, Carlo Strozzi termed NoSQL database as NoSQL because SQL is not used to manage data. Later NoSQL refers to any DBMS that does not employ relational model. 
Table shows such models:
| Operational database model | Example DBMS | 
| ---- | ---- |
| Key-value store |	Redis, MemcacheDB |
| Columnar database	| Cassandra, Apache HBase |
| Document store |	MongoDB, Couchbase |
| Graph database |	OrientDB, Neo4j |

# Data Lakes
Data Lake is central location to hold large data in raw format using flat architecture and object storage which uses metadata tags and a unique identifier to store the data. Data Lakes process structured, unstructured and semi structured data unlike most Data Warehouses. Data Lakes are used to power data science and machine learning, offers single place to look for all sources of data, and also offer users self service tools. Drawbacks are reliability issues, slow performance, lack of security. These drawbacks are overcome by  lake house.
